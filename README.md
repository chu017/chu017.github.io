# css-excercise

## Goal of the exercise

`index.html` is basic HTML page with no css style added. 
The goal is to add the CSS to this page so that the final result looks like target images in this repo

when browser is wide: 
- target-screencapture-wide.png
- target-image.png
- target-image2.png 

When browser is narrow:
- target-screencapture-narrow.png
- target-responsive.png
- target-responsive2.png

## Requirements

- The page should be responsive.
- You should not need any "frameworks" for this. 


## Instructions

- Easiest is to just make a duplicate of index.html, create your own github repo (make it public), and follow instructions on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to publish it as a github page, so you can easily share the result/code via a link with me. 
- Or if you really are struggling with github pages, you can just download the file, and send back the index.html file with css in it.
